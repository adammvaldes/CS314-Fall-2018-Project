### Edward Lee
Edward Lee is a fourth-year computer science student, who can also be referred to as EJ. He works part-time at the Carl's Jr restaurant in the Lory Student Center as a cashier. He volunteers as a leader in the group Intervarsity at CSU as well. One of his most adamant qualities is his attention to detail. He always tries perform as best as he can, and usually spends hours testing his code for bugs. Despite this, he has a tendency to procrastinate on projects that are confusing or frustrating to him. Usually quiet, he will hesitate to ask for help. Most of the work he does will be completed on weekends, which is when he is the most free for time.
