### Edward Lee
Edward Lee is a fourth-year computer science student, who can also be referred to as EJ. He works part-time at the Carl's Jr restaurant in the Lory Student Center as a cashier. He volunteers as a leader in the group Intervarsity at CSU as well. One of his most adamant qualities is his attention to detail. He always tries perform as best as he can, and usually spends hours testing his code for bugs. Despite this, he has a tendency to procrastinate on projects that are confusing or frustrating to him. Usually quiet, he will hesitate to ask for help. Most of the work he does will be completed on weekends, which is when he is the most free for time.

### Vlad Stepanuga
Vlad Stepanuga is a third year computer science student, who goes by Vlad. He is currently not employed in order to devote the most time to education. One of his best qualities is making sure he understands how all aspects of the code he writes work, therefore making himself useful when a groupmate does not understand a feature or code logic. His arguably worst quality is that he is resistant to other opinions if he believes his solution is correct. Since his schedule is flexible and open, he will be working online most of the days, so getting in contact with him will be very easy. He very frequently finishes coding halfway through a project and starts debugging code at that point.

### John Miller 
John Miller is a fourth-year student, who goes by John. He is currently unemployed, but will most likely pick up some part time work later in the semester. He plays Ultimate Frisbee for the club team at CSU. His best quality is problem solving. He enjoys thinking through the logic behind a program, and figuring out the best way to attack it. His biggest flaw, aside from spelling, is procrastination. He will do most of his work during the week, while already on campus, but he has some free time during the weekends if need be. 

### Dmitry Melnikov
Dmitry Melnikov is a third year student at CSU majoring in computer science. Previously he graduated from Colorado School of Mines with a degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. He worked as production and drilling engineer in Wyoming and Colorado, including a position as night time rig site supervisor. His focus on drilling optimization and frustration with lack of suitable software in the industry lead him to a career change with the goal of designing software that would fill that void. The industry experience helped him understand the importance of teamwork and communication. 

### Adam Valdes
Adam Valdes is a third year transfer student at CSU who is majoring in Computer Science.  After originally majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Denver he transferred to Colorado State University and changed his major to Computer Science.  His best quality is his ability to think of different solutions to a given problem.  One of his shortcomings is that he can tend to procastinate if he feels that he is already mostly done with an assignment or project.  He will be doing most of his work later in the day on weekdays or any time throughout the weekends.  

# Manifesto
**Intro**
  Our values for this group are our growth in our major, the efficiency with which our work is completed, the quality of our work, the cohesiveness of our team, and the experience our group gains overall.  

**Personal Growth**
  One of the main values for our team is the desire to learn. We are focused on gaining as much useful knowledge out of this course as possible. There is a lot of competition on the market for computer scientists and the main things that help candidates stand out are their skills. The more comfortable you are with commonly used industry tools and practices the more desirable you are for the employer. With the goal of the team and this course aligning so perfectly, we are hoping to develop skills that will be useful for the duration of our careers.  

**Efficiency** 
  We value efficiency, not only for our code, but also for our team. We value a hard-working team that can deliver a product within the time restraints we have. When we run into problems, our goal is to solve them in a timely and mature manner, whether we have problems with GitHub merging or problems within our team. 

**Quality of Product** 
  The overarching goal of our team is to create a high quality website for our customers to use. We hope to produce a smooth and easy to use interface, that is functional from start to finish. It will be the goal of every member of the team to produce the highest quality code possible, and to be constantly improving on what we have.

**Teamwork**
  Our team will strive to coordinate our work on our assignments through either Slack, direct meetings, or other communication channels.  Our team will try to divide the work on assignments clearly and fairly in order to reduce any problems with conflicting code and to properly balance the workload between our members.  We will work to review the issues and pull requests submitted by our teammates on GitHub in a timely manner and avoid committing anything directly to the master branch.  

**Industry-like Experience**
One of the main goals of CS 314 is to provide students with a similar experience to today's industry, this includes technology like SC(Github), javascript React module for single page applications, as well as Java, a very popular back-end language, and most importantly teamwork in pairs or groups and reacting to all changes or propositions made during a project. Our team values this experience since most of us will either graduate and will need to find legitimate positions in industry, or get into an internship that will also require us to know everything we will be learning this semester.

# Expectations
  We expect that each member of our team will work together in order to complete our assignments on time and according to the specifications given to us.  Each member should try to keep in contact with the rest of the team in order to coordinate our work on our assignments and minimize confusion and conflicting code.  Members should feel free to discuss and brainstorm any problems that they may run into on any of the assignments with the rest of the team in order to best complete our assignments.
  
  We expect our teammates to not only communicate during the physical lecture times, but also keep up communication and contact both in the shared github repository as well as in our designated Slack channel. Many requests to merge code into our master branch in github will be in conflict with another teammate's merge request. When this occurs, it is expected that both teammates will conduct an online meeting to figure out how to merge their code segments into the master branch safely and successfully. It is also expected that teammates will learn how to stamp issues and merge requests appropriately when using github. There should not be any excuses to not communicate the changes any teammate makes to the rest of the group.
  
  We expect that each team member contributes their share of the work. At the beginning of each assignment, we will divide the work for each member to complete. We expect every member to complete that share of the work in a timely manner to ensure we have a working project to turn in by the due date. In addition, we expect that a team member experiencing difficutly with his share will communicate and ask for help when necessary.
  
  We expect to have changes reviewed, pull requests merged and issues closed within two days of them being submitted for a review by a team member. If a teammate has a suggestion about the code they are expected to share it with the group to help us improve in the future.  We expect any code changes to be reviewed and commented if any issues appear. We expect to create small meaningful changes instead of one large before the deadline to make reviewing them easier and the development process smoother.
