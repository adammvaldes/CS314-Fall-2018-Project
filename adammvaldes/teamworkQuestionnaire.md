Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else? What hours?
	It is generally easier to reach me by either text or voice mail.  I am available in the mornings before 10 am and any time after 3 pm.

What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
	I expect that our team will be able to complete our assignments as per the specifications given and have our submissions ready by the times they are due, hopefully achieving an overall grade of at least a B.

What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
	My goals are to be able to meet with our group consistently and to remain in consistent contact in order to coordinate our work on our project.

What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
	Some of the obstacles I might encounter in trying to reach my team and personal goals would be conflict in our teammates' schedules and work habits.

What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
	We should discuss our goals for the grades for this class and how much work each of us intends to put in to achieve that goal.

Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
	As long as those team members are not doing too much more work than the rest of the team and as long as they are properly credited for doing so. If one person feels that they are doing more work than the rest of the group then we should discuss what we should do to resolve the situation.

How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
	I anticipate it will take at least 4-5 hours per week.

How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
	We should meet in order to determine best divide the work between us.

What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
	The rest of us will try to contact that person in order to determine what went wrong and how the group needs to address the issue.

What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
	We should discuss what quality goals our team wants to aim to meet.

How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
	We should do our best to coordinate our work between the different members of our group, possibly assigning different parts of the assignment to different members of the group as per their work habits if necessary.

Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
	If our schedules will allow for a consistent standing meeting time outside of class then I think we should definitely schedule for one.

How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
	Depending on the workload for each portion of the project, I think our team should meet at a minimum of once or twice per week.

Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
	If every team member is immediately available then having the approval of all of the team members for a decision would be optimal, but if some members are unavailable for some time then I think a decision reached through a majority might be valid as well.

What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
	We should attempt to see if we can come up with a compromise.  If we cannot settle on a compromise and it is affecting the rest of our work, however, we may have to follow through with the majority opinion on the matter.

What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
	Ask the rest of the group if they are okay with the situation and move to resolve the problem appropriately. If both the person in question as well as the rest of the group are comfortable with the situation then that person should be credited accordingly.  

What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
	I will bring the issue up with the rest of the group and see if we can come to a more balanced conclusion regarding the issue.
