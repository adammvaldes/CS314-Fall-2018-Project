As a team, we split up the individual tasks between the five members. Due to conflicting schedules, we planned on different times for different members to meet to work on individual projects, i.e. two members worked in the CS120 lab at one point, while two different members worked in the CS120 lab at another point in time. Although all 5 members were unable to meet at the same time, multiple people could help certain tasks at once.

## Retrospective

#### What went well
* The team communicated well over slack and in the CS120 lab.
* There were no issues in creating issues, tasks, and epics in GitHub and Zenhub 

#### Potential improvements
* Spending time physically together in the CS120 lab added to our productivity greatly in comparison to working either separately or remotely, so coordinating more of those opportunities should increase our productivity
* Dividing our workload better for our following assignments in order to better distribute the amount of work each of our members needs to do may help our team's overall performance

#### What we will change next time
