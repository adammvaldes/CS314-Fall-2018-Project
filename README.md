### Edward Lee
Edward Lee is a fourth-year computer science student, who can also be referred to as EJ. He works part-time at the Carl's Jr restaurant in the Lory Student Center as a cashier. He volunteers as a leader in the group Intervarsity at CSU as well. One of his most adamant qualities is his attention to detail. He always tries perform as best as he can, and usually spends hours testing his code for bugs. Despite this, he has a tendency to procrastinate on projects that are confusing or frustrating to him. Usually quiet, he will hesitate to ask for help. Most of the work he does will be completed on weekends, which is when he is the most free for time.

### Vlad Stepanuga
Vlad Stepanuga is a third year computer science student, who goes by Vlad. He is currently not employed in order to devote the most time to education. One of his best qualities is making sure he understands how all aspects of the code he writes work, therefore making himself useful when a groupmate does not understand a feature or code logic. His arguably worst quality is that he is resistant to other opinions if he believes his solution is correct. Since his schedule is flexible and open, he will be working online most of the days, so getting in contact with him will be very easy. He very frequently finishes coding halfway through a project and starts debugging code at that point.
