Teamwork Questionnaire for EJ Lee

Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else? What hours?
    
    Text or E-mail work the best for me. I will typically respond in the mornings before 10 or afternoons after 5 due to classes and work.
    
What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
   
   I expect there to be bumps and mix-ups in our group, but I expect our group to meet the requirements to pass, hopefully a B or better.
    
What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
    
    I want to work on asking for help when I need without procrastinating. I also hope to communicate with teammates even if there 
    are no visible problems. I want to check in on my group members to see if they need help, but aren't asking for it.
    
What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
    
    We might have conflicting opinions on how to solve a problem. We may also have conflicting schedules, or even goals in general to
    get a certain letter grade. There may be issues in deciding when the project is "done" as well.
    
What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
    
    I personally will want to get an "A", but I am okay with a "B" if that's what we earn. I think we should discuss what the team wants
    and how much time each of us has to see if we can get to an "A". 
    
Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
    
    I think it depends on how much work. If there is a lot of work to get an "A" over a "B", I think that a few team members shouldn't 
    have to carry the whole load. If there isn't that much work, I think it's okay for some members to work towards the "A", as long as
    they get credit for doing so.
    
How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
    
    Again, this depends heavily on the project. Between 5 team members, I think it should take 8 hours in the high end, and 5 hours on
    the low end.
    
How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?

    I think we should take the assignments that we want to. However, I think we can reach a point where we vote on who should take what
    assignment, based on the skills of each team member. I also think we should be adults, so we should be able to share the workload if
    necessary.

What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?

    First, all the team members should meet to talk about the problems. If that doesn't work, I think we should call a meeting 
    with the professor or a TA to talk about the behavior. If possible and necessary, omitting a person from the team is fair.
    
What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
    
    We should talk about the expectations of the group and of the assignments. If possible, having a TA look at our work to judge the 
    quality of the work.
    
How will you deal with different work habits of team members?

    This is something we should meet early on and be honest about. I think that we should keep each other in check concerning bad work
    habits.
    
Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
    
    Yes, I think that we should try to meet at least one a week to recap the work we have accomplished. If assignments start to be really
    difficult, we should try to meet more. In addition, I think the best place to meet would be in the computer science building.
    
How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
    
    Hopefully no more than twice a week all together.
    
Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?

    I think we should at least agree on the logic of our decisions. A vote may be necessary to decide on issues that can't be resolved 
    easily.
    
What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
    
    We should at least try to reason or compromise around the decision. We should understand why the one person agrees and be willing to
    change our decision. However, we should overrule the one member if the decision is taking too much time.
    
What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?

    Nothing if they are doing well in leading the group. As long as we are doing well in the class, it's okay. I will be sure to give
    that person the credit they deserve. As always, if they are not doing well a team meeting may be necessary.
    
What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?

    I'll talk with the group and TA's about it, and do my best to make decisions well for the team.
