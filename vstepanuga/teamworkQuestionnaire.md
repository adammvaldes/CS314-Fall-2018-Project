Teamwork Questionnaire for Vlad Stepanuga

    Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else? What hours?
        Text and email will do just fine. Best hours are from 5pm on Tue and Thr, as well as 3pm on Mon, Wed, and Fri
        
    What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
        I expect everyone to work at their best capabilities and produce their best result with their appropriate skill level.

    What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
        My personal goal is to improve scheduling both for myself and for my team, so we can catch every deadline.

    What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
        None.
        
    What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
        Everyone will be accountable for their additions to the project, all code must run, no matter the quality.
    Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
        Getting an A is going above and beyond, so if a member is willing to work harder to improve the feature they are working on, they should work more. We will not write code for each other however.
    How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
        Depending on difficulty level of the project, anywhere between 15-25 hours a week per person.
    How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
        All planning will be done either in virtual or physical meetings. There are no excuses to start working on something without telling the rest of the groupmates.
    What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
        Depending on the project structure, the entire project will be held back because the rest of the groupmates will have to spend time to recover the project. Groupmate in question will either be excluded from group or will have to talk with the rest of us to try to figure out the problem.
    What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
        We can assist groupmates if they ask for it, however we will not write code for anyone else but ourselves. The points are split up completely fairly, thus if the project is runnable, poor quality of code will be ignored.
    How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
        Pressure until the task is completed. If deadlines will be incomplete, further discussion will need to be had.
    Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
        Virtual meetings are a healthy asset to any project, thus I would not find having them from time to time.
    How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
        Periodically, if not quite often.
    Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
        Quite possibly upon making big changes to the solution.
    What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
        This is not about exclusion, quite the opposite on the countrary, thus making everyone happy is the top priority.

    What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
        Remind them that the project is not only their responsibility, but everybodies.
    What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
        Hold a meeting and rethink each member's responsibilities for this project.
