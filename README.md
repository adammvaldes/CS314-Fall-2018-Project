### Edward Lee
Edward Lee is a fourth-year computer science student, who can also be referred to as EJ. He works part-time at the Carl's Jr restaurant in the Lory Student Center as a cashier. He volunteers as a leader in the group Intervarsity at CSU as well. One of his most adamant qualities is his attention to detail. He always tries perform as best as he can, and usually spends hours testing his code for bugs. Despite this, he has a tendency to procrastinate on projects that are confusing or frustrating to him. Usually quiet, he will hesitate to ask for help. Most of the work he does will be completed on weekends, which is when he is the most free for time.

### Vlad Stepanuga
Vlad Stepanuga is a third year computer science student, who goes by Vlad. He is currently not employed in order to devote the most time to education. One of his best qualities is making sure he understands how all aspects of the code he writes work, therefore making himself useful when a groupmate does not understand a feature or code logic. His arguably worst quality is that he is resistant to other opinions if he believes his solution is correct. Since his schedule is flexible and open, he will be working online most of the days, so getting in contact with him will be very easy. He very frequently finishes coding halfway through a project and starts debugging code at that point.

### John Miller 
John Miller is a fourth-year student, who goes by John. He is currently unemployed, but will most likely pick up some part time work later in the semester. He plays Ultimate Frisbee for the club team at CSU. His best quality is problem solving. He enjoys thinking through the logic behind a program, and figuring out the best way to attack it. His biggest flaw, aside from spelling, is procrastination. He will do most of his work during the week, while already on campus, but he has some free time during the weekends if need be. 

### Dmitry Melnikov
Dmitry Melnikov is a third year student at CSU majoring in computer science. Previously he graduated from Colorado School of Mines with a degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. He worked as production and drilling engineer in Wyoming and Colorado, including a position as night time rig site supervisor. His focus on drilling optimization and frustration with lack of suitable software in the industry lead him to a career change with the goal of designing software that would fill that void. The industry experience helped him understand the importance of teamwork and communication. 

# Manifesto
One of the main values for our team is the desire to learn. We are focused on gaining as much useful knowledge out of this course as possible. There is a lot of competition on the market for computer scientists and the main things that help candidates stand out are their skills. The more comfortable you are with commonly used industry tools and practices the more desirable you are for the employer. With the goal of the team and this course aligning so perfectly we are hoping to develop skills that will be useful for the duration of our careers.
